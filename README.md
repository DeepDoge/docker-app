# What is this?
This is suppose to create Docker Containers and maintain them to run apps in them.
So it should be kinda like Flatpak or idk.

Only tested with Firefox for now.

# What's the goal?
Make an app packaging tool and GUI with Android like permissions using GUI.
- It should provide Android like app management.
- It should work with any package type deb, flatpak, snap, direct executables.
- It should let end user to container any app. Not just the app developer.
- Container shouldn't restrict the app but ask user for permission with a GUI.
